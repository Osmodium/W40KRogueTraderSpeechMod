	- *Nationality*: Just shows the selected voices nationality.
	- **Speech rate**: The speed of the voice the higher number, the faster the speech.
		- Windows: from -10 to 10 (relative speed from 0).
		- macOS: from 150 to 300 (words per minute).
	- Windows Only:
		- **Speech volume**: The volume of the voice from 0 to 100.
		- **Speech pitch**: The pitch of the voice from -10 to 10.
	-**Preview Voice**: Used to preview the settings of the voice.
- **Use gender specific voices**: Specify voices for female and male dialog parts. Each of the voices can be adjusted with rate, volume and pitch where available.
- Windows Only:
	- **Interrupt speech on play**: 2 settings: *Interrupt and play* or *Add to queue*, hope this speaks for itself.
- **Auto play dialog**: When enabled, dialogs will be played automatically when theres no voice acted dialog.
- **Auto play ignores voiced dialog lines**: Only available when using auto play dialog. This option makes the auto play ignore when there is voiced dialog, remember to turn dialog off in the settings.
- **Playback barks**: When clicking on points of interests in the world, the small description is called a "Bark". Enabling this feature reads the bark aloud in the narrator voice. This also applies to character "banter" which is in the same style.
- **Enable color on hover**: This is used only for the text boxes when inspecting items, and colors the text the selected color when hovering the text box.
- **Enable font style on hover**: As above this is only used for text boxes, but lets you set the style of the font.
- **Phonetic Dictionary Reload**: Reloads the PhoneticDictionary.json into the game, to facilitate modificaton while playing.

### Motivation
*Why did I create this mod?*
After having created the "same" mod for [Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/241), I got requests of doing it for this game too, and since I also wanted to play it, I gratefully obliged :).

I have come to realize that I spend a lot of my energy through the day on various activities, so when I get to play a game I rarely have enough energy left over to focus on reading long passages of text. So I thought it nice if I could get a helping hand so I wouldn't miss out on the excellent stories and writing in text heavy games.

After I started creating this mod, I have thought to myself that if I struggle with this issue, imagine what people with genuine disabilities must go through and possibly miss out on, which motivated me even more to get this mod working and release it. I really hope that it will help and encourage more people to get as much out of the game as possible.

### Contribute
If you find a name in the game which is pronounced funny by the voice, you can add it to the PhoneticDictionary.json in the mod folder (don't uninstall the mod as this will be deleted). I don't have a great way of submitting changes to this besides through GitHub pull requests, which is not super user friendly. But let's see if we can build a good pronunciation database for the voice together.
Also feel free to hit me up with ideas, issues and PRs on GitHub or NexusMods :)
