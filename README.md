**How to use natural voices.**
Install this application: [NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapterï»¿](https://github.com/gexgd0419/NaturalVoiceSAPIAdapter)
Note: It seems to only support offline voices on Windows 11 and online voices seem to crash when they are being stopped during speech.
Disclaimer: I do **NOT** intend to support issues related to the NaturalVoicesSAPIAdapter application.

#### 2) Dialog Answers
Also when in dialog, you can choose to have playbuttons for each of the dialog answers, and which color the hover effect should make the answer, so you know when you are selecting it or having it playback.

#### 3) Inspection Information
When inspecting items and links (through *right-click->Info* or just *right-click* for expanded tooltip) *hover* over the text and *left click*.

#### 4) Journal Quest and Rumors text
In the journal, each of the bigger text blocks and important stuff can be played through the play button adjacent to the text. The text blocks without a playbutton can be played by hovering and left-clicking.

The different settings (available through *ctrl+f10* if not overridden in the UMM) for SpeechMod
- **Narrator Voice**: The settings for the voice used for either all or non-gender specific text in dialogs when *Use gender specific voices* is turned on.
	- *Nationality*: Just shows the selected voices nationality.
	- **Speech rate**: The speed of the voice the higher number, the faster the speech.
		- Windows: from -10 to 10 (relative speed from 0).
		- macOS: from 150 to 300 (words per minute).
	- Windows Only:
		- **Speech volume**: The volume of the voice from 0 to 100.
		- **Speech pitch**: The pitch of the voice from -10 to 10.
	-**Preview Voice**: Used to preview the settings of the voice.
- **Use gender specific voices**: Specify voices for female and male dialog parts. Each of the voices can be adjusted with rate, volume and pitch where available.
- Windows Only:
	- **Interrupt speech on play**: 2 settings: *Interrupt and play* or *Add to queue*, hope this speaks for itself.
- **Auto stop playback on loading**: When enabled, currently playing TTS will stop whenever the game loads (through a loading screen).
- **Auto play dialog**: When enabled, dialogs will be played automatically when theres no voice acted dialog.
- **Auto play ignores voiced dialog lines**: Only available when using auto play dialog. This option makes the auto play ignore when there is voiced dialog, remember to turn dialog off in the settings.
- **Show playback button of dialog answers**: When enabled, a play button will be added next to all dialog choices. These buttons playbacks the dialog answer, while not selecting it.
- **Include dialog answer number in playback**: When enabled and pressing a play button next to a dialog answer, the playback will lead with the choice number.
- **Color answer on hover**: This enables highlighting the dialog choice that corresponds to the play button that is hovered.
- **Playback barks**: When clicking on points of interests in the world, the small description is called a "Bark". Enabling this feature reads the bark aloud in the narrator voice. This also applies to character "banter" which is in the same style.
- **Only playback barks if silence**: When enabled, barks are only played if there is no other TTS playback currently playing. Can be useful with the next option.
- **Playback vicinity and cutscene triggered barks**: When enabled, all barks that are automatically played by either triggers or cutscenes, will be played. This can cause a lot of overlapping of playbacks. Hence the prior setting to only play when silence. Might look at some sort of system where automatically played barks, are low priority, compared to manually started playbacks.
- **Show notification on playback stop**: When this is enabled, a notification will show on the screen that the playback was stopped when the keybind for stopping is pressed. This keybinding can be set in the game menu under "Sound".
- **Color on hover**: This is used only for the text boxes when inspecting items, and colors the text the selected color when hovering the text box.
- **Font style on hover**: As above this is only used for text boxes, but lets you set the style of the font.
- **Phonetic Dictionary Reload**: Reloads the PhoneticDictionary.json into the game, to facilitate modificaton while playing.

### Motivation
*Why did I create this mod?*
After having created the "same" mod for [Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/241), I got requests of doing it for this game too, and since I also wanted to play it, I gratefully obliged :).

I have come to realize that I spend a lot of my energy through the day on various activities, so when I get to play a game I rarely have enough energy left over to focus on reading long passages of text. So I thought it nice if I could get a helping hand so I wouldn't miss out on the excellent stories and writing in text heavy games.

After I started creating this mod, I have thought to myself that if I struggle with this issue, imagine what people with genuine disabilities must go through and possibly miss out on, which motivated me even more to get this mod working and release it. I really hope that it will help and encourage more people to get as much out of the game as possible.

### Contribute
If you find a name in the game which is pronounced funny by the voice, you can add it to the PhoneticDictionary.json in the mod folder (don't uninstall the mod as this will be deleted). I don't have a great way of submitting changes to this besides through GitHub pull requests, which is not super user friendly. But let's see if we can build a good pronunciation database for the voice together.
Also feel free to hit me up with ideas, issues and PRs on GitHub or NexusMods :)
